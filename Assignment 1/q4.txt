Firsly, use input and int function to let user input the number and transform it into integer.
Secondly, use print function and '\t' to get the correct format of the first line, such as: m        m+1      m**(m+1)
Thirdly, make M=1
Fourthly, use while loop, while M<=N (the interger that the user puts in), our put a line.
During this process, I define 3 variable to represent the result of the corresponding calculation.
For the output, my print function is written as it to ensure the sheet is in order: print('\t',a,'\t',b,'\t',c,sep='')
after the process, make M=M+1 to meet the requirement of the while loop.
