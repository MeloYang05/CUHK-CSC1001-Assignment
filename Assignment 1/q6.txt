Firtly, use infinity while loop to judge whether the input is correct. the method is :if a.replace('.','',1).isdigit() and b.replace('.','',1).isdigit() and n.isdigit() and c in ('sin','cos','tan'):
if true, do the following part. if not, print out:please check your input and try again, note that a and b must be number, n must be integer, and the function can only be written as sin, cos and tan
then use eval function to change the input into the number that we want.
Then import sin, cos, and tan for calculation:
Then use while loop to do the integration:
At last, partly put out the result.
