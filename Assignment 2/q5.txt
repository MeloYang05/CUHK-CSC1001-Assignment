Firtly, build a dict by for loop from 1 to 100 and put every keys a value:closed.
Then use while loop: while n<100, because there's 100 childs to change the state of the locker.
the change the locker, we should use such code to determin the correct location: if i%n==0:
After finding the correct location, if the values in the dictionanry is close, we change it to open, elif it is open, we change it to close.
Lastly, we use the following codes to output the result.
for key,value in numberdict.items():
    if value=='open':
        print('L',key,' ',value,sep='')
