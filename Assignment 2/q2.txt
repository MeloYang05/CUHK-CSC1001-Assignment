Firstly, def the function: check_prime to determin whether a number is a prime number. The details is shown in the last assignment.
Then use for range method, the upper should be a very large number, at this time,we choose 10000000. Then we change
every elements in the list into strings, and use[::-1] to change get its reversal. If the original and the reversal
both meet the requirement, We will append this number into the primelist.
For the number in the primelist, we output it using such ways tocount=0
for a in prime_list:
    print(a, end=' ')
    count=count+1
    if count %10==0:
        print() ensure that it will change the line every 10 items.
